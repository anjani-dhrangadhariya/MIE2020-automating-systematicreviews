A Systematic Review (SR) aims to answer a well-framed clinical or research question using an explicit, systematic methodology with an aim to reduce the bias.
A well-framed clinical question clearly specifies the PICO variables of interest which are the target \textbf{P}opulation, the \textbf{I}ntervention of interest, the \textbf{C}omparator intervention, key \textbf{O}utcomes~\cite{Thabane2008, cochraneHandbook}.
The next step after framing a research question is to develop a comprehensive search strategy in order to retrieve/harvest all the studies pertaining to the question at hand~\cite{cochraneHandbook}.
An initial search creates a list of studies that require screening for appropriateness before any meta-analysis can be carried out.~\cite{pmid12612111}
An eligibility criteria is defined for assessing appropriateness of these studies and only those studies meeting the set of predefined criteria are included for further analysis, while the rest are excluded~\cite{cochraneHandbook, pmid10832224}.
